This blog will serve as a tool where I will be posting about my readings for research purposes. 

I am currently developing my master's thesis, and I have been reading various papers and articles that I intend to summarize and post for you to read.

Additionally, I aim to present some of the projects I developed and continue developing in my academic and professional life.

I hope you enjoy my posts and increase your interest in Computer Science, an area that has so much to offer in our society.

In the next post, I will present the project I am currently working on to develop my thesis.
